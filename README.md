#ECE 401-403: Senior Project

##Doorlock Holmes


	A motor controlled locking system for a front door. The system will implemented using a Raspberry Pi, a microcontroller, a small motor, and a standard deadbolt door lock. The Raspberry Pi will act as the user interface which will listen for commands. Once a command is received the Raspberry Pi will then communicate with a microcontroller to trigger the desired result. Upon receiving the command from the Raspberry Pi the microcontroller will be used to control the DC motor position by using motor feedback, which will result in locking or unlocking the deadbolt locking mechanism. The process will take less than 10 seconds starting when the Raspberry Pi and stopping when the deadbolt has been moved to the proper position.
